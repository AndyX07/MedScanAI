## Inspiration
I was inspired to solve this problem by UN Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Lung Cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. In 2020, over 1.8 million people died from lung cancer, accounting for around 18% of all cancer related deaths. Experts believe that this number could be significantly reduced if there were swift and early diagnosis for the patients

## What it does
MedScan AI accurately detects and diagnoses 3 types of lung cancers: adenocarinoma, large cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma. MedScan AI also generates medical report detailing the diagnosis, confidence, and also next steps/treatment methods.

## How we built it
The model was built using Tensorflow using the MobileNetV2 model. The website was built using HTML, CSS for the front end and Flask for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
Initially the model was built using VGG16 however, the model was not accurate for certain test cases, so the model was changed to MobileNetV2 which provided better accuracy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of being able to build a working product in a short period of time and creating a product that hopes to solve a big issue in society.

## What we learned
I learned how to effectively design and build a product from start to finish. I also expanded my knowledge of machine learning and web development.

## What's next for MedScan AI
I hope to expand MedScan AI to not only detect lung cancer but other cancer and diseases as well.
